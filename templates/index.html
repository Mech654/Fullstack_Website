            Welcome to Fresh, Cheap, and Tasty—where American desperation and dark choices have become our daily specials. We’ve managed to stay open this long by doing what we had to do, but time is running out. And now, we need your help. Not just for us, but for your own sake.</p>
        <p>When you place your order—and believe us, you will—don’t forget to leave a little donation. We’re not asking, we’re telling you. It’s just a small price to pay to keep us afloat. And trust us, you want us to stay afloat. Otherwise, you might just end up as our next “special ingredient.”</p>
        <p>Oh, and don’t even think about leaving without dropping a 5-star review. That’s right—a perfect review. After all, Timmy's watching. You remember Timmy, don’t you? He’s still here, in spirit… lingering in the shadows of the kitchen, keeping an eye on everyone who walks through our doors. You wouldn’t want to upset him. A 5-star review should keep him calm, for now. But neglect to do so? Well, let’s just say, Timmy doesn’t take kindly to disrespect. And you wouldn’t want a visit from him, would you?</p>
        <p><strong>So go ahead, order, review, and donate. And stay tasty.</strong></p>
